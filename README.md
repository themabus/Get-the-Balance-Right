# Get-the-Balance-Right
This is 256 line C++ [tinyraytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer) by Mr. Dmitry V. Sokolov ([ssloy](https://github.com/ssloy)) ported to several higher level game engines.<br>
Some older ones (but still quite popular) and some more recent ones.<br>
![original](original.png)<br>
All projects are made to display execution time in milliseconds, so that performance could be measured.<br>
Operations include: trigonometry, vector math and data structure handling.<br>
It is unoptimized - no lookup tables, no fixed-point, inlining, etc.,<br>
which presents more life-like model and evens out the playing field.<br>
Shaders are not used.<br>
Drawing routines are not timed.<br>

* OpenGMK, RGDirect and MKXP are runtime replacements for already assembled binaries.<br>
* Execution times below 1 sec. reported with higher precision.<br>
<br>
These projects could also be useful as a 'Hello World!' programs, when moving from engine to engine<br>
and you want to familiarize yourself by jumping right in, instead of going through tutorials.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

I added for reference timings from MS DOS16/32 version using various compilers and extenders, <br>
running on Am5x86 133, which is basically a beefed up 486. They used to rate them as Pentium 75 or 90,<br>
but that was largely marketing - they were noticeably weaker than those. I'll probably come back to this<br>
and update it with optimized version - lookup tables/fixed point math, which would be typical<br>
for this hardware. Probably won't do assembler optimizations though.<br>
<ins>Update</ins>: got optimized 32bit version down to <ins>4060</ins><br>
