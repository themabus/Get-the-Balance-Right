# Get-the-Balance-Right
I ported this 256 line C++ [tinyraytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer) by Mr. Dmitry V. Sokolov ([ssloy](https://github.com/ssloy)) <br>
to several game engines that use higher level languages. <br>
Some older ones (but still quite popular) and some more recent ones. <br>

All projects are made to display execution time in milliseconds, so that performance could be compared. <br>
Operations include: trigonometry, vector math and data structure access. <br>
Output to screen is not timed.<br>
Shaders are not used.<br>

These could also be useful as a 'Hello World!' programs, when moving from engine to engine<br>
and you want to familiarize yourself by jumping right in, instead of going through tutorials.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
